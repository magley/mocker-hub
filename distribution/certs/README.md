Note: If you are on Windows, execute these commands under git bash (or any system supporting POSIX openssl).

`certs.rar` includes a sample certificate and private key.

1. Generate a self-signed certificate:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_key.pem -out cert.pem
```

2. We'll also need the base64 certificate payload (that is, without the headers). For that purpose, we can convert `.pem` into `.der` and then convert the binary `.der` into base64:

```sh
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -outform der -out cert.der
base64 cert.der > cert.der.b64
rm cert.der
```
